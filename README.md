# puresec-microservice-js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fhopeman/puresec-microservice-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fhopeman/puresec-microservice-js)

This library is part of the [puresec ecosystem](https://github.com/fhopeman/puresec-master). It defines the macro architecture for every nodejs microservice. That means it provides functionality which has to be implemented by all services. E.g. the health check is part of that common macro architecture.

If you will build up your own nodejs microservice, this library helps you to concentrate on the real funcionality.
